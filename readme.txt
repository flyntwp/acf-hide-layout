Easily hide the layout of the flexible content on the frontend but still keep it in the backend.

== Description ==

Sometimes you may need to hide/remove a flexible content layout from showing on the frontend of the website, but you would still like to keep it in the backend in case you need to re-enable that layout again in the future.

Of course you can always just remove the layout, but if it’s a complex group of fields with a lot of data, re-creating it later would be a pain. And here the **ACF Hide Layout** plugin comes into play. It adds a small button with an "eye" icon to easily disable/enable flexible layout content without removing it.

See more info on the [plugin website](https://flyntwp.com/acf-hide-layout/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
